# 📖 Overview

AI Language Detection System is a machine learning-powered web application capable of identifying the language of a given text in real time.

The application uses a **CountVectorizer** to transform text into numerical features and a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier to predict the language. A modern Streamlit interface provides an intuitive experience with confidence scores, probability distribution, and interactive examples.
